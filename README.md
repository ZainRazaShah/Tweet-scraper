# Tweet-scraper
This script pulls twitter data using Tweepy & sends the datasets via email as attachments.
The project is deployed on Heroku.

To use this script, you will need a Twitter Developer account of your own. You can sign up
for one by visiting https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access

The developer account takes a few days to get approved. Once approved, you will need to create a new
app & use the API keys associated with the subject app in this script.
